# LinkedIn Post Brief: EGX Stock Price Prediction

This document provides context for an LLM to generate a professional, engaging LinkedIn post about the **EGX Stock Price Prediction** project.

## Project Essence
- **What is it?** A local, desktop-based AI application specifically for the Egyptian Exchange (EGX).
- **Primary Goal:** Empowering personal investors with deep learning forecasts and institutional-grade risk metrics.
- **Unique Selling Point:** It brings advanced "Quant Finance" tools (usually reserved for hedge funds) to a simple, local Python desktop app focused on the Egyptian market.

## Key Features for Highlighting
- **Deep Learning Core:** Uses PyTorch-based **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models with **Attention Mechanisms** to predict price movements.
- **Federated Learning:** Supports "FedAvg" where models can be trained across multiple stocks to capture broader market patterns without compromising individual data.
- **Institutional Risk Metrics:** Every prediction is paired with **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Sharpe Ratios**, teaching users to think about risk, not just returns.
- **Interactive Visuals:** Beautiful, interactive Plotly.js charts integrated into a PySide6 (Qt) interface.
- **Built-in Strategy Engine:** An "Assistant" that provides Buy/Hold/Sell recommendations based on model conviction.
- **Trade Journaling:** Allows users to log simulated trades to track their performance (win rate, return analytics) over time.

## Technical Keywords (Buzzwords)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML)
- PyTorch & LSTMs
- Federated Learning
- Quant Finance / Financial Engineering

## Desired Tone for the Post
- **Professional yet Accessible:** Explain complex ML/Quant concepts simply.
- **Local Focus:** Emphasize the specialized focus on the Egyptian market (EGX).
- **Disclaimer-Heavy:** Must mention that this is for educational/personal use and not financial advice.
- **Innovation-Driven:** Highlight the use of Federated Learning in a local desktop context.
